# My Microcontroller Projects  

Hi! 👋  
This is where I share all the projects I’m working on with **Arduino**, **ESP32**, and **STM32**. I’m a student learning and experimenting with electronics, and I created this repository to share my work with others.  

## 📂 What’s Here?  
- Code and files for my projects.  
- Examples of cool things you can do with microcontrollers.  

## ⚙️ Tools I Use  
- **Microcontrollers**: Arduino, ESP32, STM32  
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, STM32CubeIDE 
- **Languages**: C/C++  

## 🌟 Why I Made This  
I love learning new things and want to share my progress and ideas. Feel free to use my projects or give me tips to make them better!
